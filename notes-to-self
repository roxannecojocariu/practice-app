use rails command for db

rails generate migration create_articles OR rails g etcetc

rails db:migrate && rails db:rollback && rails db:migrate

when creating db and adding a table, first go to migrate folder to add columns that include type of column (string, number, etc) and null false, etc at the db level.

model will do the validations at the model level
